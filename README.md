Pokedex APP

This is my first JavaScript Project.

It consists of a Pokedex App which retrieves information from an API to display on a usable and responsive app. For this App, I used HTML, CSS and JS, along with external libraries like Bootstrap and JQuery.

Simply click on any of the 150 Pokemons, and details about them will show.
